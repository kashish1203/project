_Description:_ <br/>
The dataset presented here was obtained through the process of web scraping from ESPNcricinfo, a prominent and reliable source for comprehensive cricket-related information. Web scraping is a technique that automates the extraction of data from web pages, allowing us to compile a detailed dataset on various aspects of cricket matches. ESPNcricinfo, being a renowned platform, provides up-to-date and in-depth statistics, including the number of matches played, matches won and lost, points earned, and net run rate for each country. Through this web scraping process, we aim to deliver accurate and timely insights into the performance of cricket-playing nations, enabling a thorough analysis of team dynamics and tournament standings.

_**Task : Design, develop, and deploy an ML RESTful API**_<br/> 
Choosen API : FastAPI<br/>
_**File: FastAPI.zip**_<br/>
Best ANN model is deployed using the FastAPI<br/>
**STEPS:**<br/>
Step 1: Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
Step 2: Create a FastAPI object
Step 3: Design Your API, **file : main.py**
Step 4: Define an ML Endpoint
Step 5: Run the FastAPI Application Locally
Step 6: Integrate ANN Model , **file: modelInference.py**
For this we have created an additional API endpoint /predict_winner that uses the loaded ANN model(pkl file) to predict the winner of a match based on the provided input data (team1, team2, venue).
Step 7: Test the Endpoint using Thunder Client
